Yes! It's all vanity, it's all an illusion,

everything except that infinite shy’

Ata glittering society party in St Petersburg in 1805, conversations are
dominated by the prospect of war. Terror swiflly engulfs the country
as Napoleon’s army marches on Russia, and the lives of three young
people are changed for ever. The stories of quixofic Pierre, cynical
Andrey and impetuous Natasha interweave with a huge cast, from
aristocrats and peasants to soldiers and Napoleon himself. In War
and Peace (1863-9), Tolstoy entwines grand themes — conflict and
love, birth and death, free will and fate - with unforgettable scenes of
nineteenth-century Russia, to create a magnificent epic of human life
